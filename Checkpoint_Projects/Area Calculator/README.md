# 📐 Area Calculator
This is a simple Python program (calculator.py) that calculates the area of basic geometric shapes. It's a great exercise for learning conditional statements, user input, and basic math operations in Python.

## ✨ Features
- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Calculates area for the following shapes:
  - 🔺 Triangle
  - ▭ Rectangle
  - ◼️ Square
  - ⚪ Circle
- Clean and readable output
- Option to quit the program

## 📊 Area Formulas
| Shape | Formula |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Square  | area = side²  |
| Rectangle  | area = length × width  |
| Triangle | area = (base × height) / 2  |
| Circle  | area = π × radius² |
	
You can use either 3.14 or Python’s math.pi for more accuracy in circle area calculation.
