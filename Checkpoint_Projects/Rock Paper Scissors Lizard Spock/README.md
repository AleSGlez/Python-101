## 📜 Description
This project is a fun and expanded version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, known as Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, made famous by the TV show **The Big Bang Theory**. It was invented by **Sam Kass** and **Karen Bryla** to reduce the number of ties that occur when you know your opponent too well.

The game adds two new choices to the traditional three:

- 🦎 Lizard
- 🖖 Spock

These additions create more possible outcomes and make the game more dynamic and strategic.
