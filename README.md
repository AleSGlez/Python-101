# 🐍 Python-101: The Legend of Python

> *"Every hero starts somewhere... This one starts with a print statement."*

Welcome, adventurer! ⚔️ This repository contains my journey through **Python 101**, a course from **[Codedex](https://www.codedex.io/)** where learning to code becomes an epic quest.

Inspired by *The Legend of Python*, this quest takes me from the basics of programming to mastering spells like loops, functions, and objects. 🧙‍♂️
