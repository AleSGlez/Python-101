# 🪣 Bucket List and Recap of Python Lists

## 🎉 Congratulations!
Here's a quick summary of what you've learned:

- ✅ **Lists** store multiple items in a single variable.
- 🔢 **Indexing** lets you access items by position (starting from 0).
- ✂️ **Slicing** allows you to access parts of a list with `list[start:end]`.
- 📏 **Built-in functions** like `len()`, `max()`, and `min()` help analyze lists.
- 🛠️ **List methods** like `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, and `.pop()` let you modify lists.
- 🔁 **Iteration** lets you loop through items using `for` loops.

Now let's use everything and create a bucket list!

## 🛒 Bucket List Program (`bucket_list.py`)
Create a Python program that contains a list of things you want to do in your lifetime:

```python
# Write code below 💖

things_to_do = ['🏯 Go to Japan', '💍 Get married', '💵 Buy myself a Mini Cooper', 'Get a job in my dream job']

for i in range(len(things_to_do)):
  print(things_to_do[i])
```

### 💻 Example Output
```
🏯 Go to Japan
💍 Get married
💵 Buy myself a Mini Cooper
Get a job in my dream job
```
